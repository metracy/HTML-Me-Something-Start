                <h3>Early Broad Band Era 2003-2008</h3>
                <p>Sites such as YTMND - You're the man now Dog! became an absurd collection of simple memes with music on a background. This internet absurdism went on to be

                    While YTMND went down back in 2019 it's influence on internet culture can not really be overstated.
